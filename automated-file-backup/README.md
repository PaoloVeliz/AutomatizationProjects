# Project Name: Automated File Backup

Project Description:
Create a Go script that automates the process of backing up files from one folder to another. This project will help you learn about file operations and basic scripting.

Project Requirements:

 * Choose a source folder: Select a folder on your computer that contains files you want to back up.

* Choose a destination folder: Create a backup folder (e.g., "Backup") where you'll store the copied files.

Automate the backup process:

* Write a Python script that scans the source folder for files.
* Copy each file from the source folder to the destination folder.
* Schedule automatic backups (optional):
* Implement a basic logging system to keep track of when the backups were performed and which files were copied.


# Skills I Learned:

* File and folder operations in Go.
* Basic error handling and exception handling.
* Automation and scripting.
* Scheduling tasks.
